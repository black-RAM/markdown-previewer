# Welcome to my React Markdown Previewer!

## This is a sub-heading...
### And here's some other cool stuff:

Here's some code, `<div></div>`, between 2 backticks.

```
// this is multi-line code:

function generatePassword(length) {
  const charset = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789!@#$%^&*()_+{}[]|;:,.<>?";
  let password = "";
  for (let i = 0; i < length; i++) {
    const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * charset.length);
    password += charset[randomIndex];
  }
  return password;
}

const password = generatePassword(12);
console.log(password);

```

You can also make text **bold**... whoa!
Or _italic_.
Or... wait for it... **_both!_**
And feel free to go crazy ~~crossing stuff out~~.

There's also [links](https://www.freecodecamp.org), and
> Block Quotes!

And if you want to get really crazy, even tables:

Wild Header | Crazy Header | Another Header?
------------ | ------------- | -------------
Your content can | be here, and it | can be here....
And here. | Okay. | I think we get it.

- And of course, there are lists.
  - Some are bulleted.
     - With different indentation levels.
        - That look like this.

1. And there are numbered lists too.
1. Use just 1s if you want!
1. And last but not least, let's not forget embedded images:
